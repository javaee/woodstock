<h1><a name="1"></a> 1 Introduction</h1>
<p>
This document will try to introduce the features and capabilities of the
Woodstock Theme implementation. The expectation is that the developer will
be able to perform the following tasks with the help of this document. But this
document is not intended to be the only resource needed to successfully
perform these tasks. For example creating a component jar with theme
support or creating a theme will most likely require more intimate
knowledge of the theme implementation including reading java documentation
and source code.
<ol>
<li>Modify theme characteristics at the application level.</li>
<li>Understand how theme properties for components can be defined and
delivered in a jar file or application</li>
<li>Understand how to create a new theme distinct from 
<code>webui-jsf-suntheme.jar</code>. This is a very difficult task and
this document cannot guarantee that a successful alternate theme can 
be created that drastically alters the theme implementation from the 
standard <code>webui-jsf-suntheme.jar</code> implementation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Some History and Setting  Expectations</h3>
<p>
Software begins its life attempting to satisfy  a specific set of 
requirements. Over time those requirements change and the software is sometimes
used in environments or with expectations that are not addressed by the
original requirements. It is then modified as time and resources 
allow to try and meet the needs of the new requirements.
</p>
<p>
The Woodstock Theme is such software. It began as a mechanism to encapsulate
a "brand" and to allow brand changes to be accommodated with as little
change as possible to component implementations. The intent was to ensure
that all applications using the components expressed a particular brand. 
An application could express a new brand, by replacing the old theme
jar with the new one; no recompilation was necessary and in some cases
the web application did not have to be redeployed or re-released.
This is a different problem than allowing an application to be 
"skinned" and allowing the "skin" to be changed at will. Such a feature
needs a sophisticated level of abstraction and data organization to make
it effortless to utilize and create alternate "skins".
</p>
<p>
It is important to set expectations about the Theme so that 
effort is not wasted trying to accomplish very difficult tasks.
Some theme modifications can be accomplished fairly easily
and some require herculean efforts. For example changing a particular
image from one file to another is simple and straight forward but changing
the location of that image within a complex component is not as simple and 
straight forward.
<h2><a name="1.1"></a>1.1 What is a Theme ?</h2>
<p>
Logically speaking, the Woodstock Theme is a set of characteristics 
that express a consistent look across the set of 
Woodstock components. For example the theme implemented in
<code>webui-jsf-suntheme.jar</code> expresses the current SUN 
brand as defined by the
<a href="http://xdesign.sfbay/projects/swaed/uispec4_0/index.html">SWAED
(Sun Web Application Experience Design) 4.0 guidelines</a>.
</p>
<p>
The definition of the theme is purposely restricted to "look" or "skinnable"
characteristics to set expectations appropriately given the current
theme implementation. In reality the brand includes layout and interaction
as well, but it requires much more effort to include that set of 
characteristics as "skinnable", since the work required is more
than just a change to a property value.
</p>
<h2><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 The Theme Resources</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
The Woodstock Theme is implemented as a 
<a href="theme-properties-table.html">set of properties</a> defined in
Java ResourceBundle Properties files that represent the following
categories:
<ul>
<li>
Image properties that define an image file, width, height and alt text.
</li>
<li>
Message properties for button text, tool tips, etc, and in some cases data
(mostly because we didn't create a "data.properties") and in most cases
these data properties are not translated, unlike textual properties.</li>
<li>
CSS properties that define "style classes" or CSS selectors
and CSS style sheet files that must be included in an application page.
</li>
<li>
Javascript properties which define Javascript name spaces and 
Javascript files that must be included in an application page.
</li>
<li>
Template properties that define an HTML file or the literal HTML used
as a template for components that are implemented as Javascript "widgets".</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All categories of characteristics can be localized as necessary, meaning that
any theme property can have a different value based on locale.
</p>

<h2><a name="1.3"></a>1.3 The Theme Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
The "
<a href="theme-infrastructure.html">Theme Infrastructure</a>"
is a "catch all" phrase for the Java
classes and in some cases Javascript code that implements the 
behavior that provides the values of the theme properties to web
applications and the Woodstock components at runtime.
</p>
<p>
This behavior is defined by interfaces and concrete classes 
defined and implemented in the <a href="theme-infrastructure.html">
<code>com.sun.webui.theme</code></a> package. These classes define
how Theme properties are found and delivered to the web application
and Woodstock components at runtime.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.3">
<code>ThemeServlet</code></a> which is used to provide theme resources
like image files, css files, etc. to the browser client.
</li>
<li> The <a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.1"><code>ThemeContext</code></a>
which is a class that attempts to encapsulate the runtime theme environment
for web applications and components.
</li>
<li>
An implementation of 
<a href="javadoc/webui/com/sun/webui/theme/ThemeFactory.html">
<code>ThemeFactory</code></a>
<a href="theme-infrastructure.html#10.5">
<code>SPIThemeFactory</code></a>.
</li>
</ul>
